    <div class="e-content"><h2 id="an-improvised-story">An Improvised Story</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ll indulge me for a minute, I&rsquo;d like to start with a personal story. I swear this is going somewhere :).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m visually impaired, and one thing I sometimes worry about is body language. This is because I usually don&rsquo;t see people&rsquo;s gestures, facial expressions and other signals sent by the way they stand or move sends. I&rsquo;ve also been playing improv theater for a few years, and while I really enjoy it, I often feel hesitant to use body language, or mime certain actions. I also often feel unsure of how to interpret the body language of fellow improvisers, waiting for verbal cues to act upon.</p>
<p>In a recent improv course, I was asked to play a scene with the following setup: I was a man who, during his midlife crisis, &ldquo;fooled around&rdquo; a lot. My wife left me and entered a monastery. After some time I realised I had squandered the only thing that had made me happy, my wife, so I went to the monastery to try and win her back. When joining the order, my wife had taken a vow of silence, so she couldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>So I had to play a scene where my co-player couldn&rsquo;t speak. At first, I found myself falling back to what I know best, <em>words</em>. With someone who doesn&rsquo;t speak, that just becomes a monologue, which is not what you want for a 2-person scene. Physical interaction made things more interesting. When I went in to try to give her a hug, she backed away. This created a new interesting dynamic. After that I felt out of ideas on what to do. I got some very helpful hints from the trainer on playing with position; taking some distance or getting closer.</p>
<p>After the scene was over I talked about the uncertainty I felt, and had a very nice conversation with the trainer and fellow players about ways I could use the limited amount of visual information I had, and techniques to offer physical opportunities for developing a scene.</p>
<p>Taking part in this exercise, I felt incredibly vulnerable. I always feel like i can talk my way through every improv scene, and suddenly, that skill became useless. I felt incredibly supported by the others, especially after that conversation at the end, and it encouraged m</p>
<h2 id="i-dont-know">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Often, saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;, and leaving your comfort zone are equivalent. You&rsquo;re comfortable with something because, at least to some degree, you know what&rsquo;s going to happen, and you know what to do. When you leave your comfort zone, you don&rsquo;t know what might happen, you don&rsquo;t know how to react, and you&rsquo;re afraid of being hurt or humiliated.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to encourage you to seek out those limits in an environment where ou trust the people around you. If you&rsquo;re in a good trusting team, try taking on some of those issues related to parts of the code base you&rsquo;re not familiar with, or using a library you haven&rsquo;t used before. If you&rsquo;re in a great team, take advantage of that environment to say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; often.</p>
<p>Afraid of public speaking? Give a talk to share knowledge at your department or team. If that&rsquo;s something you really want to work on, I can also greatly recommend joining a <a href="https://toastmasters.org">Toastmasters club</a>. They&rsquo;re a supportive community who&rsquo;ll give you constructive feedback every step of the way towards giving great public talks and presentations. I&rsquo;ve seen people who joined our club in Maastricht, and go from trembling and using &ldquo;um&rdquo; every other word, to passionate speakers. They could only go through that change because they had the courage to say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to talk to a group confidently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So what narrow part of your comfort zone is holding you back? Look for a supportive environment where you can explore your boundaries, and see where you can expand them.</p>
